I&#39;m JoÃ£o Matos, and my journey in the realm of technology ignited at the tender age of 6 when my uncle introduced me to my very first laptop - a Toshiba Satellite A70. My family fondly recalls my early years spent in the server room of my grandfather&#39;s company, where I gleefully &quot;assisted&quot; my uncle. While my memories from that time may be somewhat hazy, it&#39;s quite possible that my affinity for Linux traces its roots back to those days! ðŸ˜„</p> <br/> <p class="big">At the age of 14, I embarked on a self-guided exploration of coding, a journey I&#39;ve never veered from since. My programming voyage commenced with Python but quickly evolved to encompass the intricacies of more low-level languages like C/C++. My active involvement in the Open Source community has been both rewarding and fulfilling. I&#39;ve not only contributed to numerous projects but also developed software that continues to be in use, some even within my own academic institution.</p> <br/> <p class="big">Beyond my tech endeavors, I&#39;m also a man of the arts, thanks to the influence of my father. I have a knack for painting, find solace in writing, and revel in the world of books. This creative side of mine complements my technical skills and fosters a well-rounded perspective.</p> <br/> <p class="big">My approach to learning complex subjects is characterised by a unique adaptabilityâ€”I can seamlessly pivot to grasp any language or technology. My innate ability to comprehend intricate concepts led me to the remarkable feat of independently crafting a Blockchain from scratch in C++ at the age of 16/17, among a myriad of other captivating projects. I specialise in low-level systems and network programming, hacking and malware development, and decentralised computing with a focus on Blockchain.</p> <br/> <p class="big">My experiences within the Open Source sphere have also honed my ability to excel in large team settings and navigate projects with extensive codebases. I&#39;m committed to the art of crafting clean, well-structured code that adheres to best practices, accompanied by meticulous documentation. Furthermore, my affinity for the arts equips me with exceptional communication skills.</p>';return{c(){e=r("div"),e.innerHTML=a,this.h()},l(t){e=c(t,"DIV",{class:!0,["data-svelte-h"]:!0}),l(e)!=="svelte-e2qx6f"&&(e.innerHTML=a),this.h()},h(){m(e,"class","whoami")},m(t,o){p(t,e,o)},p:h,d(t){t&&d(e)}}}function x(n){let e,a;return e=new k({props:{title:n[0],$$slots:{default:[I]},$$scope:{ctx:n}}}),{c(){y(e.$$.fragment)},l(t){g(e.$$.fragment,t)},m(t,o){v(e,t,o),a=!0},p(t,[o]){const i={};o&2&&(i.$$scope={dirty:o,ctx:t}),e.$set(i)},i(t){a||(b(e.$$.fragment,t),a=!0)},o(t){w(e.$$.fragment,t),a=!1},d(t){$(e,t)}}}function M(n){const{title:e}=_;return[e]}class A extends f{constructor(e){super(),u(this,e,M,x,s,{})}}export{A as component};
